# Hi, I'm Gaohar Imran 👋

I build intelligent systems at the intersection of **Machine Learning and Generative AI**.

My work focuses on designing reliable, end-to-end AI systems — especially 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM evaluation, and real-world ML deployment.

---

## What I Work On

- Designing **RAG pipelines** to reduce LLM hallucinations
- Building **evaluation frameworks** for model reliability
- Developing complete ML systems: data → training → inference → deployment
- Deploying scalable AI applications using cloud infrastructure

> A model is only useful when it is reliable, grounded, and deployable.

## Technical Focus

### Machine Learning & Generative AI
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- LLM evaluation & hallucination analysis
- CNN-based feature extraction
- NLP pipelines & text classification
- Model optimization and validation

### Tools & Stack
- Python
- Transformers (HuggingFace)
- LangChain
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

### Deployment & Systems
- AWS (EC2, S3)
- Docker
- API-based model serving
- Scalable inference pipelines

---

## Current Direction

- Improving factual grounding in LLM systems
- Building production-ready AI pipelines
- Studying system design for ML infrastructure
- Strengthening mathematical foundations behind ML

---

## Learning Philosophy

- Build > Consume  
- Systems > Scripts  
- Depth > Hype
