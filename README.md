# Hi, I'm Gaohar Imran 👋

I build **end-to-end AI solutions** using Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

My focus is not just on training models, but on designing **complete AI systems**
that work in real-world conditions — from data preparation to deployment.

---

## What Defines My Work

-  Building **applied ML / DL systems**, not just experiments
-  Handling the **entire AI lifecycle**: data → model → inference → deployment
-  Turning ideas into **working, usable AI products**
-  Optimizing models for **performance, reliability, and scalability**

> _A trained model is only valuable when it can be used._
